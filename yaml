## 🚀 How It Works

### 🖥️ Server (`Server.java`)
- Starts a server on port `1234`
- Accepts incoming client connections
- Creates a **new thread** (`ClientHandler`) for every client
- Broadcasts any message received from a client to **all connected clients**

### 👤 Client (`Client.java`)
- Connects to the server via IP and port
- Sends user input to the server
- Listens for incoming messages using a background thread
- Displays received messages in real-time
